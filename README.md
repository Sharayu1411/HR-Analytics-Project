# HR-Analytics-Project

### Project Overview
- The HR Analytics Dashboard created in Power BI is a comprehensive tool designed to provide insights into various aspects of an organization's human resources data. 
- The dashboard is divided into four main sections, each serving a distinct purpose in understanding and optimizing HR processes: Home, Departmental Analysis, Attrition Analysis, Income Distribution.

### Data Source
HR Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "HR_1.xlsx" and "HR_2.xlsx" files, containing detailed information about employee and human resource.

### Tools
- Excel: Data Cleaning
- SQL: Data Analysis
- PowerBI: Creating Reports

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing values
- Data cleaning and formatting

### Data Analysis
Analysis part is done using some interesting code/features of SQL.

### Key Features of the Dashboard
1. Home: The Home section acts as the primary interface, providing an at-a-glance summary of key HR metrics.

3. The satisfaction levels are relatively consistent across departments, with scores ranging from about 2.46 to 2.51 out of a potential maximum. Support has the highest job satisfaction score, while Hardware has the lowest.
4. Research & Development has the highest attrition rate (51.21%), followed by Software (50.54%) and Sales (50.02%). Hardware has the lowest attrition rate at 49.44%.
